        "The problems with the Rising Winds (Amtgard) are rooted in cluster B traits. Grab the DSM V and turn to page 659 (If you have the same edition I do, this will take you to page one of the section on cluster B personality disorders). Trait #2 of APD-Deceitfulness. When someone has buddy connections, those connections are often used either to avoid a bann or get someone banned under false or exaggerated pretenses, this is how APD-T2 effects Amtgard culture. Trait #4 of APD, irritability and aggressiveness (In other words emotional instability, in other words you could also lump BPD (Borderline personality disorder) trait #8 in here). Anyhow with APD-T4/BPD-T8 this effects Amtgard culture because emotional instability is normalized to an extent where lashing out violently against others is easily forgiven and banns based on such can be overturned easily. Time and time again my insiders tell me of someone who has actually harmed other players through emotional instability and gotten back in with considerable ease (Well, insiders only informed me of three so far while I witnessed two more while in Amtgard). This overturning of banns based on emotional instability leading to actually bringing physical harm onto others is a prime example on how APD-T5 effects Amtgard culture. When someone is banned based on slander, those doing the banning have no remorse, those slandering have no remorse, this is how APD-T7 effects Amtgard culture. Now turn to page 663 of the DSM V. BPD-T1 have a rather indirect impact with Amtgard culture, this effect assists the so called buddy connections as those who help substantiate a false accusation or assist in a witch hunt based on logically fallacious reasoning as those with this trait are afraid of a sort of abandonment if they do not side with their \"Buddy\" thus those with this trait easily conform to mob mentality. There only being two traits of BPD that have effected culture in such a way make it the least problematic influence, especially when the BPD-T1 is only a problem when the trait holder is influenced by people with the other traits of concern, and when it comes down to it, you can pretty much bundle most of the BPD traits up in the category of \"Emotional instability\" and that's essentially an APD trait so if APD cultural influences have normalized such, BPD trait holders won't get help, and if the Stoic Standard I came up with was introduced into Amtgard, this could be fixed to an extent. Further more, BPD is often a misdiagnosis, this misdiagnosis could be corrected and result in someone getting diagnosed with Bi-Polar personality disorder, or even C-PTSD in which develops in response to a form of abuse that requires many of the other traits I am covering here, meaning they are may be more of a product of the problem than a source of it. Now turn to page 667 of the DSM V. The 2nd trait of HPD (Or HPD-T2) has a rather unusual effect on Amtgard culture, sexual expressions are suffocatingly in abundant, (People jokingly dryhumping everyone or sexually propositioning another......) an asexual must either pretend to be an allosexual to fit in, cope with such through humor as a way to treat the sexuality that is smothering you as a joke, or simply isolating one's self from those acting out allosexual specific culture. This trait also creates in people the expectation that all guys want and enjoy sex, completely disregarding asexuals whom would much rather have a back rub, the hyper sexualization of culture is problematic but has many intricacies that at first glance seem to be comprised of conflicting details, for example in my study of human sexuality I found that some laws actually create kinks by creating a thrill that only exists from breaking said law thus being the critical factor in drawing appeal to said kink. Now onto HPD-T6, now people in amtgard tend to often exaggerate their emotional reactions to help implement someone in \"Harming them emotionally\", this tactic is fairly common and used as to be louder than reason, in other words someone can accuse you of looking at their breasts when you were just looking at a pendant you were struggling to ask to see while trying to use body language to express you wanting to see such and then exaggerate how hurt and scared they are when you shatter their ego by saying something that when translated and summarized amounts to saying you don't find them sexually attractive and you just wanted to see their pendant (Reality check, asexuals don't find anyone sexually attractive, let alone sacks of jiggly fat lumped onto a chest. If we want to reproduce we will actually be more picky in our selection of mates than allosexuals are). HPD-T7 is essentially the same problem/influence as BPD-T1 in that it aids mob mentalities against unwelcomed yet inherently harmless minorities. Now, turn to page 669 of the DSM V (This trait list continues on page 670). When someone is able to justify lying to either get themselves exonerated from a bannable offense, or are willing to lie about another as to get them wrongfully banned, they need to have a grandiose sense of self-worth to be able to justify throwing another under the bus like that, hence NPD-T1. We often see people whom are simply power hungry successfully gaining said position of power, their preoccupation with that power only becomes critically obvious when they abuse such and refuse to step down from their position of power when exposed but instead resort to silencing others who have called them out, hence NPD-T2. The poorer you are the less influence you have and the less financially you will be able to contribute to the park no matter how strongly you wish to contribute, people in higher standings have been known to use what they've been able to afford to contribute as a means to persuade others into taking their side beyond what the \"Buddy connections\" can do on their own, when this is combined with other factors (For me it was atheism/autism/asexuality along with being someone who rarely has even $50 a month to spare on themselves let alone amtgard), the social system of Amtgard is prone to spitting you out and disregarding anything you were able to contribute, in a round about way (Perhaps this is a bit of a stretch) Amtgard if personified regarded me as lower class and spit me out on said basis, hence NPD-T3. Now onto next trait that has influenced Amtgard culture, people who have gained positions of power in Amtgard, often target people they feel did not give them the level of respect their ego has them feeling they deserve, to them they should be placed on a pedestal (Not all of those in power, just far too many of them), in this way said people exemplify NPD-T5. (Turn to page 670 now). Now, when it comes to something that is called narcissistic supply, a critical cluster B trait holder (less strict standard than referring to someone who is able to get diagnosed thanks to the trait count minimum, cultural, and age of onset barriers in the diagnostic criteria) gains immense pleasure when they are able to successfully slander someone and throw them under the bus and gain being treated as if they are the victim in the process, also these people are plentiful in Amtgard and (So it can be presumed as to being a part of Amtgard Culture), this is a form of interpersonal exploitation hence an example of NPD-T6. Now onto NPD-T7: when someone is projecting and are called out for projecting they are often infuriated as they have most people fooled into thinking they are highly empathetic people and they don't like being called out on such. Those who have empathy, empathize, those who don't have empathy learn to project, and those who's projection has become skillful enough to fool the majority still can't fake empathy if they are exposed to someone who is critically different from the norm (Asexuality+Atheism+Autism will do this) and so they tend to target said person as to take them out of the picture projecting their own extremely toxic traits onto the victim in the process of forcing said person into isolation. One time I was having a health problem my doctor told me to lay down if I experienced it again, it was raining really bad out at an Amtgard event and I sought refuge under an open awning, the world was spinning and my eyesight was going in and out, when it went out everything was all black with splotches of purples, greys, and different shades of blacks, but mostly black. I was confronted by someone who was using the tent for their house, they weren't direct or straightforward (In which for an autistic is incompatible social behavior), I was depending on them to be empathetic and understanding until I recovered enough to get up and even asked if there was someone around with medical experience who could help me, well this was used against me and I was painted as some sort of bad guy for \"Invading their space\". The lack of empathy is far too normalized in Amtgard culture, hence NPD-T7 is at work culturally. Now skipping NPD-T8 as I really can't tell if this even matters through my observations. Onto NPD-T9, in Amtgard, assuming things is the norm and being inquisitive while encouraging others to also be inquisitive is regarded as toxic behavior... the thing about that is, well assuming something that brings harmful/hurtful consequences onto someone is a matter of someone being too arrogant to accept that their assumptions may be false and harmful, this also plays into mob mentalities that work against inherently harmless minorities, while looking down on those who are inquisitive and trying to get others to be less arrogant in regards to the assumptions they make about others can indeed be regarded as haughty behavior, hence NPD-T9 is indeed a part of Amtgard culture. Amtgard culture should provide a safe space away from cluster B types, not house them and let them gain dominance. Amtgard culture is just an example of Cluster B culture, in fact everything that is wrong in this world aside for what human beings could have prevented or simply can't change can be traced to one or more of these traits I've listed as the core enabler. If you want to get banned from Amtgard while being a decent human being, the most surefire way is to be autistic/asexual/atheistic while calling people out for exhibiting one of these traits I've listed at any opportunity you get as not only will people not understand, acknowledge, or respect your differences.... but then you will be stepping on the toes of those whom have gained power in Amtgard.",
        "If I were manipulative and toxic then my bann wouldn't have had to be based on lies, further more your conduct here is a very typical representation of a toxic person's behavior, so in reality Amtgard is ran and populated by a lot of toxic people and it's really you calling me toxic that does not mean anything especially when you know nothing about what happened. My body's nerves are so screwed up that the most enjoyable touch I can feel is that which comes from a back massage and that's on top of not finding anyone sexually attractive (asexuality). So when the same people who had been calling me creepy for reasons related to body language started claiming I violated COC #3, I was especially offended and when I pointed it out that I was asexual and lacking in any motivation what so ever to doing what was accused of me all the while I mourned the lack of sensitivity in my body while feeling like I was drowning in aspects of allosexual specific culture, they backpedaled and changed it to a coc #6. When I returned I tried to correct the record but was met with nothing but annimosity at every attempt as making the truth known would also by extention oust the liars. I was later on banned for COC #6 again for not letting one of those whom helped that initial slander campaign walk all over me on the Misty Hallow facebook page. You have no idea what you are talking about, your habit of assuming everything and not asking for any details is quite repulsive to me.I'm asexual, nothing creepy about that, and given your utterly trollish conduct here, I'm quite certain there are plenty who think you should be banned.LOL, calling me manipulative, if that's not projection I've no idea what is. You guys couldn't bann me for honest reasons so you had to lie and manipulate everyone into believing you, sorry but manipulation is only manipulation if it is intentionally manipulation and it succeeds, you guys hit the mark on both.",

        "A confession/bragging on a certain someone's post for one, the lack of accepting entries that would specifically hurt her ego while not even using her name but only using details that would bother her specifically, and a writing style that matches her's in some of the entries using her name.",

        "I've experienced enough of Nicholas Cage to know what she is, but not enough to do anything else. Psycho-analyses is in two parts: 1-assessment, and 2-treatment, and an assessment is all I can do.

        "You're so defensive, surprised I haven't mentioned that yet? It's well known you are her are good friends, and I've had problems with you in the past, birds of a feather. Anyhow, yeah the IP addresses would have to be compared regularly every time the posts were made within a certain period of time meaning closely together and since she often posts on her phone where it is difficult to do certain functions, that illusion should be rather easy to maintain.",
        "I never said I was a psychologist, my name is in fact spelled Jon, that's not some sort of typo put on my profile and never fixed. I have no \"stake\" in taking Nicholas Cage down, she's a part of a bigger problem. The way she is is akin to live electrical wires without any protective coating on them. My interest in psychology only covers a subject that is a very small portion of the DSM V, not something you need a degree for, while psychologists use far more textbooks than simply the DSMs. Note, when I say Narcissist or Narcissistic, I am not necessarily referring to Narcissistic personality disorder, but am using such generically as the DSM V actually allows someone to evade a diagnosis through three different ways (Cultural, developmental, and through restricted contexts). When I say narcissist, I am simply saying that at least five of the traits in the criteria are there while the diagnostic exemptions may or may not be present.",
        "It's ironic because your efforts show already that it's too late to make such claims. Your defensiveness on this topic is also kind of ironic being the amount of effort you are putting into all of this.",

        "you can use terms like \"pretend Freud\" all you want, but the reality is that you simply don't know what I am talking about much of the time, hence your incentive to simply brushing it off in such a way. Anyhow, here you are still playing.......",
        "you've not even remotely proven that what I am saying is false, also mind you lying for a friend is a common occurrence and everyone aware of that problem. It's so ironic that you assisted a slander campaign on me but are spending so much effort on arguing this. If it's false, someone with no positive or negative association with Nicholas Cage would need to provide said evidence, not one of her buddies, so your purpose here seems clear: Humoring me.",

According to the short period he took to reply after I posted that link (Approximately 6 minutes), he only had time to read from 1200 to 2400 words in it, and that's if he's a skilled reader. Context and subtext are important, actually taking the time to read and understand that article just wouldn't hold compatibility with the conclusion he already started wanting to push. The thing with sharing this link is that narcs always project these tactics onto the poster when such is used in an argument of sorts.",

I'd like to think people who believe speed reading isn't nonsense to be more common than people who are so eager to project onto others that they won't read the details of something as to gain the contexts and subtexts, hence why my primary conclusion was that you thought you were speed reading and by making that known, I opened said conclusion up for a refutation attempt and then you responded in such a way that gave away the fact on what you really did, you avoided taking in the article's details all together. Contexts and subtexts don't matter to people who just want to project negativity onto others, and so that simply matches your motive.",

        "No, a lame assumption that's supported by your projection of the way you think onto me. Do you honestly think I'd be so bold as to talk how I am talking if I wanted back in? Amtgard is ruined by the very same culture I am studying, that's why I am here.",
        "Why would you be banned if you mesh well with the problems?",
        "How do you make a toxic person comfortable with showing their true colors, emulate them to an extent. How do you retain your own integrity in the process, keep it mild and use little known facts that conflict with popular opinion. Admittedly, I am baiting a little bit, I'm just surprised I didn't block these two after an incident. But yeah, Nicholas Cage did admit to it and I know Caskey there is tight with Nicholas Cage and helped a slander campaign. If I don't get some more examples of the kind of conduct I am farming for examples of here, I just won't be able to test some of the conclusions I have. Above you'll find another calling me stupid while claiming to know what an Ad hominem is, he then goes silent on the topic after I call him out for not knowing what such is. Anyhow.....

As for Ad hominems the article I posted handles that argument for me. He seems to think that an ad hominem is any sort of name calling or character trait callout, well it's not. The fact of the matter is, he didn't know what an Ad hominem was. When I visited your profile, I didn't see the profile of an idiot, no there were some pretty good indications of intelligence and so the jig was up. While Daniel Caskey feigned to know how to devalue my statement on IP addresses (IP addresses change yes, but not as often as he tried to imply). While I remember encounters with Daniel Caskey, I did not remember any with this other guy, however I did find some references to him in my screenshot collection. I can take you seriously and don't feel I can get anything from trying to fool you so I'll just end the jig here.",

Well, it seems you are making the same such assumption, okay, quote where I made an Ad hominem attack and I'll go from there. Chances are you are seeing a mentioned reason for doubt and thinking it is an ad hominem. In debates only ad hominem fallacies matter, otherwise such only serves as a sort of distraction. If something is being debated or discussed with much disagreement then that sets the context on what matters. Sadly my education doesn't compare to your's, surely, but I've simply not as much to work with here, I can't help but to tip my hat to you.",
        "I know better on that, and there you go with the gaslighting",

        "LOLs, yeah you've deluded yourself into thinking you've got things figured out, you aren't that bright there. \"In bad faith\"? I was banned in bad faith, as many help groups for dealing with cluster Bs will tell you, sometimes using their own traits against them is necessary, especially in legal battles. Since Amtgard is full of cluster Bs, I decided to see what I could do with such and since I deem it too toxic to return to, I decided to go ahead and use it for testing that statement. I found a way that actually works in filtering out for some of the traits I find concerning. By this \"Homework\" I'm betting you just asked around a little, but then again you might have simply read some of my public posts on my profile, not at all impressive really. Impressive would have been using online resources to find the email associated with my facebook. Anyhow, it humors me that I am bothering you so much that you are still at it at this hour in the night, er I mean morning as it is 5:21 in the morning here, but hey if you have a job that I am ultimately interfering with, I'm sure that doesn't mean you were likely an idiot child and are simply projecting now lol",

Hilarious, that was intentionally convoluted (I got the idea from the anime Bastard, Dark Schneider's tactic in warfare was to take a route no one could follow for the very reason no one could follow it). Anyhow I backspaced what I wrote back there multiple times changing it up. I put it right there in your face and you never called it out, you are just being too butthurt about not calling it out to accept the reality, then you had to go and say all of that about IP addresses as if they are never stable for long enough to do what I was talking about.",

        "the thing is, I'm not really predictable to you, you've just assumed such would bother me. If in your shoes, I would make a prediction, video record myself stating the prediction and the time of said prediction, post it private on facebook, then make it public to prove said predictability. Your actions speak louder than words, what are you if not butthurt? Your emotional responses are typical rather than atypical.",
        "No, it's not a conspiracy theory, cluster B traits really have shaped culture and there are plenty of psychologists who agree, are you really so dense as to think we'd have a president who's practically the poster child for Narcissistic personality disorder if it weren't so? Seriously, a team of psychologists are trying to get him removed from office through the 25th amendment, and then there's the runner up who also shows all traits of such, especially if you read her book. Anyhow, it doesn't matter how I look to people like you, I mean every other sentence that comes out of your mouth is some form of toxicity, and that's really all that you have and I am quite glad I can bring that more to the surface for others to see. Have you even tested the question submission system? Have you even made a list of things that your suspects would censor? Each person has some unique things they personally would censor if in the position of the person running this page. The censorship habits match Nicholas Cage's perfectly while some of the earlier posts featuring Nicholas Cage's name match the sense of humor she portrayed while she had the profile photo of King Nicholas Cage from the Dragon Ball franchise. But then here's the doozey, your connections with Nicholas Cage mean that she will likely hear this and change her habits with this page as to avoid further suspicion, or since I said she'd do such there would actually be no change at all. You see the problem with mentioning all of this and you being a friend of Nicholas Cage's means that now these points are public and them being public can change the game to the point where it is nearly impossible to prove who's behind such other than perhaps observe the posting habits for indications of nervousness such as not posting at all for a while, posting a ton in a burst, or posting content that was originally decided against. Anyhow, this page does not function as if a page would that was moderated through a cell phone but rather one that is moderated through a PC, if you've ever dealt with copy and paste features on the cell phone you'd understand such, but the there's the further details regarding posting time habits and some minor deviations from the norm in conduct of the poster. The rules Mention \"Admins\", the deviations leave room for \"Admins\" but at most a total of three, but more likely just two and considering the circumstances regarding the number of people saying to avoid this page and report it for abuse, these two likely share a living space with eachother or at least spend a ton of time together. Anyhow, one of the admins is only active about 20% of the time that the other is active as indicated by the level of deviation present. Find a notebook and start writing down the times and dates that each post is made on, there is a pattern and that pattern does have a slight deviation. The first time I backspaced I touched on this, the second time I wrote, I tried to make it much more vague, the third time I backspaced on such I decided that I wanted to somehow kill a bunch of birds with one stone and so a few more backspaces later I decided to use the whole spiel on psycho-analysis, on one hand it gave me something to help me avoid sharing all of this, on another hand it offered something that could be called out by someone who actually has some brains as to make obvious to me when I would no longer be able to keep the jig up on such as I knew such was sloppy and not well thought up, next it offered me a means to troll you through, and finally it allowed me a way to prove that you have opinions on things without looking up what they are, hence arrogant presuppositions. Seriously, all over the internet you'll find quite easily people talking about the great flaws in the so called psycho-analysis and I managed to what? Give you one of the few links that didn't speak of such as if invalid..... gee I wonder why -_-, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out that such requires actually trying. The experiment side was simply testing for trait usage, and I'd have to say I did such in way that seems too sloppy to be anything but nearly inconclusive at best in which frankly means I should get more information on the actual methods used, the only one I am currently aware of is how to incite narcissistic rage, but that one requires me to have something nice to say about you in which sadly I do not. Anyhow, the hilarious thing is, you do recognize that I had you on some things, hence all of those more recent comment edits of yours to try and make readers here think a little differently, I'm not impressed.",
        "Correcting you guys on this conclusion you are dead set on, no I freely speak as poorly as I please on both of you, that's not an indication of wanting to return but the opposite. And further more, most people say people like you can't be reasoned with, but I see you are less than a one pager kind of guy. Hilarious that you are saying you did the very same thing I talked about in the post above.",
        "I never did anything they accused me of, I'm asexual and have no motive at all especially when it comes down to my nerve problem in which were ironically well known. It wasn't them being nice, it was them being ableist and then switching to slander, and then simply labeling me toxic. I would have taken it to court and won if it was made a COC #3.",
        "accusing me of sexual misconduct as to try and validate an insult that was originally ableist in nature to weaponize said insult rather than having it make them look bad is slander. I was called creepy because my body language is unnatural and I am unable to read body language and thus as a result require people to be open honest and straightforward with me. Dig deep, originally one of my bans was going to be a COC 3 until I showed it was a lie, but that did not remove my bann, they just completely ignored that such slander was toxic behavior and then proceeded to bann me for COC #6 instead.",
        "I am not responsible for the slander of others, I am not responsible for the toxic reactions of others and I am tired of being expected to beI wish to start a new Larp group separate from Amtgard and pull people in from Amtgard who are tiring from the toxicity in Amtgard, don't assume, make inquiry... Amtgard is a lost cause.Last time I did that for this topic I was told I was imagining things. Do that google search, what I will tell you afterwards won't be easily brushed aside afterwards and giving you the search terms rather than a link does not restrict your observation and cause bias. There's a huge problem with prejudice that lead to a falsified re-contextualization of an insult as to serve for a tool for victim blaming.",
        "If it's verbal, I have my reasons to continue when I do continue, otherwise I stop. I am taking a gamble, I do believe they are one of those whom are running this page, I have more information that supports this but if I mention it, her behavior will adapt again as it has adapted already from what I have posted. Unfortunately sharing this other piece of information will not put a timestamp on the indication related to said change of behavior. Did you ever google the search term I gave you, or are you assuming it leads to nonsense?",
        "Why would I care if it would be a ruse or not? If he decides to start trying to be civil, then I'll show some respect. Respect is earned, giving heightened levels of respect as freely as many expect is stupidity resulting from not learning from history.",
        "It was a mixture of slander and libel both times, the second time being more libel than slander. Start by googling \"aspergers creepy\", tell me what you find then we'll talk."
